## Matthew Wilding

I am a software engineer who specialises in architecting scalable systems using **C#**, **Rust** and **TypeScript** powered by various cloud providers.
When I am not building enterprise grade software, I am writing tools in Rust, or tinkering with my **Neovim** config.

In my spare time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and consistently work on side projects. I am also an avid reader and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices.

I use **Arch Linux** and have a deep interest in reverse engineering as well as game development using **Unreal Engine** (**C++**).
