# Matthew Wilding

I am a full-stack software engineer who specialises in architecting scalable systems using Rust, C# / .NET, TypeScript, React and various cloud providers.

In my spare time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and consistently work on side projects. I am also an avid reader and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices.

I use Arch Linux and Neovim and have a deep interest in reverse engineering as well as game development using Unreal Engine (C++).
