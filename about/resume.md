# Matthew Wilding

I am a full-stack software engineer who specialises in architecting scalable systems using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/languages/csharp), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [React](https://react.dev) and various cloud providers.

In my spare time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and consistently work on side projects. I am also an avid reader and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices.

I use [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) and [Neovim](https://neovim.io) and have a deep interest in reverse engineering as well as game development using Unreal Engine (C++).
