## Matthew Wilding

I am a software engineer who specialises in architecting scalable systems using C#, Rust and TypeScript powered by various cloud providers.
When I am not building enterprise grade software, I am writing tools in Rust.

In my spare time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and consistently work on side projects. I am also an avid reader and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices.

I use Arch Linux and have a deep interest in reverse engineering as well as game development using Unreal Engine (C++).
